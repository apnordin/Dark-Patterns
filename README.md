# Dark Patterns

This application was deployed using Heroku. It can be found [here](https://dark-patterns-324.herokuapp.com/).

## The Goal

Dark Patterns are UI design "strategies" used in websites and apps that trick the user into doing things they didn't mean to, such as purchasing a product or subscribing to a service. The purpose of this website is to provide a realistic simulation of a user interface riddled with dark patterns, so that users may be more familiar with them and able to spot them elsewhere on the web. You may notice that the layout and user experience of this website is similar to that of a popular and intuitive tax-filing service, which many have pointed to as an example of a website that unrelentingly uses dark patterns. Most of the dark patterns you will encounter on this simulation are pulled directly from my experience using that service.

My other goal was, frankly, to build an appealing, functional, and dynamic front-end (with obvious design cues borrowed from the previously mentioned tax-filing service). As I've progressed in my programing journey, I've mainly focused on building a strong back-end with a minimalist, functional-but-simple front-end. This project has been an opportunity for me to flex my front-end muscles, while solving problems that arise from having a dynamic, single-page, React application whose content changes depending on user input.
